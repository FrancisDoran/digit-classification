## Roadmap
### ETL
- download data
- identify any format changes needed
- identify any needed cleaning
- split test and training sets (scikit learn)
- load data in a pytorch native format for efficiency
### training
- setup real time data pipeline
- assess best optimizer 
- assess best loss function
- set up model
- optimize training workflow
(This is an itterative process based on human observation)
- what metrics should be used?
- train to satisfaction
### deployment
- write an interface that take a image and returns a classification.
### write up
- update as you work
- clean up and finalize at the end
- consider any data vis that could capture the training process
### stretch goal
- solve a simple math problem from a photo
### division of labor
